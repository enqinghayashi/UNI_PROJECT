# UNI_PROJECTS

This repository contains various university projects across different programming languages. Each project is organized into its own folder, with a focus on distinct programming languages and topics. Below is an overview of the projects included.

## Folder Structure

- **C_Project**: Contains projects written in the C programming language.
- **Java_Project**: Contains projects written in Java.
- **Python_Project**: Contains projects written in Python.
- **SQL_Project**: Contains projects that use SQL for database operations.

---

### C_Project

This folder contains projects related to the C programming language. The focus is on system-level programming and other topics covered in your university coursework.

#### Example Projects:
- **runml**: A transpiler written in C11 that translates a mini-language (ml) into C, compiles it, and executes the generated program. 
  - [README](./C_Project/README.md) - Contains more detailed instructions for the `runml` project.

### Java_Project

### Example Project  

**Message Delivery Status Tracker**  
- A Java application that determines whether messages should be delivered or dropped based on their timestamps and a configurable delay threshold \(k\).  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Uses a HashMap to track the last delivery time for each message.  
  - Compares the current timestamp with the last delivery time to decide delivery status.  
  - Returns a list of `"true"` or `"false"` indicating delivery (`"true"`) or drop (`"false"`) for each message.  

**This project highlights the use of collections, control structures, and efficient algorithms for solving real-world challenges.

### Python_Project

This folder contains Python-based projects, with applications ranging from data analysis to scripting and automation.

#### Example Projects:
- **Population Analysis**
- **Regional Population Analysis**

---

### SQL_Project

This folder contains projects related to SQL and database management. The focus is on writing queries, creating and managing databases, and handling data efficiently.

#### Example Projects:
- **DatabaseDesign**: An example SQL project involving the design and implementation of a relational database.
- **AdvancedQueries**: A collection of advanced SQL queries that demonstrate complex data retrieval techniques.
